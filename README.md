## Instructions:
My main file is the `challenge.js` file. With the JSON locally stored in `views.json`

## About:
First and foremost, I understand this does not function exactly as planned. However, I do believe by implementing a while loop and recursively searching the object I could return all values of the given keys so as to be used as `selectors`. I really enjoyed this challenge and implementing different ways of solving it and using best practices to the best of my ability.

Side note: there may be such a thing as too many comments after looking at this. I did also attempt to solve this using an http request instead of having the file locally, but it seemed like locally was the way to go.

I appreciate your time and consideration!
